# signals-for-tailwindcss
Signals for Tailwind CSS is a plugin that simplifies the process of applying styles based on an ancestor's state using style queries (container queries). It provides a declarative API for signaling states, eliminating the need for complex selector chaining and arbitrary targeting, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.
